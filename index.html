                <h2><span>Father</span></h2>
                <p>This is my father, he is the second father to me. She is a lesbian but never in my life did I feel she was a woman, I only felt her love as a father and mother for us. Even though she is a woman, she is not just a woman because she can do even the tasks of a man, nor did I feel her lack because even though we are not related by blood, I feel that she can tax her life for us. I am very proud of him because it is not only his love for us that I admire, he actually has skills that are really very impressive, it is the construction of the house, he made the entire rental and the one we live in now, he can also be a painter, laborer, and plumber she can fix the broken things in a house which is really amazing as a woman because not every woman or man can do it. So I am grateful
                     because I have a father who is hardworking, 
                     loving and can fight us in any fight</p>

                <h2><span>Mother</span></h2>
                <p>This is my mother she is the one who motivates our family to work hard she treats me like a princess she never allowed me to wash dishes and washing our clothes when I was young but suddenly people thought that I will grow up without knowing
                     this kinds of households but they shock because
                      I grow up independent women.

                <h2><span>Brother</span></h2>
                <p>This is my brother Kristtan Rae Cabatic you can call him "Moymoy" he is the headache of the family but he is the one who gave blessings to our family because he immediately gave mom and dad a grandchild isn't he really a headache haha. But I am very proud of him because at a young age he was able to revive himself early,
                     he worked hard in life and founded things that he really worked hard for.</p>
